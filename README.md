# Github-Insider

An angular quick app to try a different approach in the workflow of components, introducing directive components.

On future updates, I'll also connect it to webpack, and open up the posibility of working with ES6 and other magical stuff.

###Getting Started###

Simplest way to get this on your local:

Click [here](https://github.com/Tora1024/Github-Insider/archive/master.zip) then download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
	> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Now open you browser with 'Localhost:8000' to test it out locally.
